    "We all *know* that we should be testing, but there are a lot of potential pit falls that one can fall into when starting down this journey. I'm going to jump into the deep end of the pool here and deal with one of the struggles that it took me a while to deal with. \n",

    "Imagine the following:\n",
    "- You have a local device with a REST API\n",
    "- You write a library that accesses that REST API\n",

    "- You push the library to GITHUB so that other people can leverage your work. ( You are a good person, right?) \n",
